# MotorizedWindowBlinds-ESP32
Geared motor of window blinds that can be accessed wirelessly with an ESP32 using a WebServer

## Description and Usage
The goal of this project was to use a geared motor with a custom 3D printed support to be mounted to window blinds so that they could be manually or automatically controlled via an ESP-32 microcontroller. By connecting the device to the local network, it would be possible to control the blinds with a basic WebServer and an infrared receiver.
